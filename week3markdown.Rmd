## R Markdown

### R Markdown subhead

This is *some italics*

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

And this is a demo document 

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Now I'm going to introduce some of my own data.

I'll first load the packages:

```{r, echo = F}
library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
wbdata <- jsonlite::fromJSON(gzcon(url("https://github.com/cjbarrie/CS-ED/blob/main/data/web_historian_data.json?raw=true")))
```

And now I'm going to count some of its properties:

```{r}
wbdata_mp <- wbdata %>% 
  group_by(domain) %>%
  count() %>%
  filter(n >5)
```

And now I'm going to plot it

```{r}
  wbdata_mp %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(domain, n), stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip()
```

```{r}
summary(wbdata)
head(wbdata_mp)
summary(wbdata_mp)
```

```{r}
bydate<-wbdata %>% 
  group_by(date) %>%
  count() 
```
